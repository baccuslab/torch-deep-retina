## Models

This folder has model checkpoints of the models used in the Neuron paper as well as the models from the previous paper [Deep Learning Models of the Retinal Response to Natural Scenes](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6388-deep-learning-models-of-the-retinal-response-to-natural-scenes). Models that have the word `drone` prepended to the file name refer to the models from the previous paper.
